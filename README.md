## Core Technical Innovations

### Layer-by-Layer Octree Storage

The octree implementation uses a storage pattern where each layer is stored sequentially from leaves to root, with collision space pre-allocated at the end of each layer. Layer offsets and sizes are mathematically pre-calculated based on maximum particle count, allowing each layer to determine the next layer's starting position without pointer traversal.

This design eliminates pointer-based tree structures, keeping all octree data in contiguous memory regions that maximize GPU residency and enable efficient parallel processing across the entire tree structure.

### Custom GPU Radix Sort

The project implements a complete GPU radix sort from scratch, providing full control over the sorting process without relying on Metal Performance Shaders. This custom implementation features:

- **Multi-pass prefix sum algorithm** with auxiliary buffers designed for large datasets
- **Split-based radix sort** supporting 64-bit keys with memory-efficient ping-pong buffers
- **Optimized for Apple Silicon** with 64-thread workgroups for optimal occupancy
- **64 separate passes** processing all bits of Morton codes for complete spatial ordering

This custom implementation was necessary because Metal Performance Shaders don't provide the level of control needed for the specific Morton code sorting requirements of the Barnes-Hut algorithm.

### Morton Code Optimization

The Morton code implementation supports up to 21 bits per spatial direction (63 total bits), providing extremely fine spatial resolution. Testing with particle counts from 10,000 to 500,000 revealed that using only **7 layers (21 bits total)** provides the optimal balance between spatial partitioning and individual particle isolation.

At this depth, most individual particles maintain their own leaf nodes, ensuring maximum accuracy in the Barnes-Hut approximation while minimizing computational overhead. This optimization was determined through empirical testing rather than theoretical analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Barnes-Hut Force Calculation

The force calculation kernel implements a **stack-based traversal algorithm** for optimal performance. Each particle traverses the octree using a depth-first approach, maintaining a stack of nodes to visit. The algorithm applies the theta criterion (Î¸ = 0.7) to determine when to approximate distant particle groups as single masses.

**Key optimizations include:**
- **Early termination** for self-interactions
- **Force clamping** to prevent numerical instability
- **Softening parameters** to handle close particle encounters
- **Stack-based approach** that minimizes memory access patterns

### GPU-Optimized Data Structures

All data structures are designed for optimal GPU caching and memory access patterns:

- **PositionMass struct** combines position and mass data in a single cache line
- **OctreeNode struct** includes all necessary information for force calculations, lighting, and tree traversal in a compact format
- **Shared structs** between Swift and Metal through the bridging header for zero-copy operations
- **Optimized buffer layouts** for coalesced memory access

## Engineering Trade-offs: Performance vs. Visual Fidelity
